## 🧰 How to Add a New Tool

1. Create a file in `tools/` — e.g. `tools/my_tool.py`
2. Extend `BaseTool` and implement `run()`

```python
from tools import BaseTool

class MyTool(BaseTool):
    name = "my_tool"
    description = "What this tool does in one sentence"
    usage_example = "example of what input this tool receives"

    def run(self, input: str) -> str:
        # Your logic here
        return "result"
```

3. Restart the agent. **That's it.** The tool is auto-discovered.

## 🧠 How It Works

```
You type a task
      ↓
Brain (Groq LLM) reads the task + available tools
      ↓
Brain decides: which tool? what input?
      ↓
Tool runs → returns result
      ↓
Brain sees result → decides next step
      ↓
Repeats until task is done
      ↓
"respond" tool → final answer shown to you
```
